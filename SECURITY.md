# Brand Promise

Keeping user information safe and secure is a top priority for
us at Amethyst. As such, we welcome the contributions of all
security researchers.

# Scope

If you believe you've found a security issue in any website,
service, or software owned and/or operated by Amethyst you are
required you to notify us in accordance with responsible
disclosure practices to be protected by this policy.

# How to Submit a Report

To submit a vulnerability report to Amethyst, please contact us
at [report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live). Your
submission will be reviewed and validated by a member of our
triage team.

# Safe Harbor

Amethyst supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations,
  destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our
  services.
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit
  permission of the account holder. If you do encounter
  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
  immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge
  any local information.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve
  vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a
  third-party.

We will consider activities conducted consistent with this
policy to constitute "authorized" conduct and will not pursue
civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. We will
help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a
third party against you.

Please submit a request to us before engaging in conduct that
may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

# Preferences

- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a
  clearly defined impact.
- Submit one vulnerability per report.
- Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is
  prohibited.
