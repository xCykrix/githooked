# Support for Amethyst

Welcome to Amethyst's suite of projects! We use CodeBerg issues
for tracking bugs and handling feature requests, so those are
not the right place to get support for our projects. Please make
use of the resources below to get support for our products.

## Discussions and Live Chatting

Still need more assistance? Reach out to us in
[our Discord Server](https://invite-to.amethyst.live/). Here we
can offer more real-time support and attempt to solve your
issues faster.

## Documentation

All of our projects have automatically generated documentation
based on in-line documentation that is generated at each push to
main and staging.

## Security and Official Support

All else failed you? Reach out to us at
[support@amethyst.live](mailto:support@amethyst.live) for
official support, and
[report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live) for security
related concerns. These requests can take longer to process, but
will be reviewed by the time and appropriately responded to.
