### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you
for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate
carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail
in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance
to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your
  side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions
  (Make sure that you have read the project's documenation. If
  you are looking for support, you might want to check
  [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially
  already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
  is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in
  our bug trackers.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack
  Overflow) to see if users outside of the CodeBerg community
  have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime
  environment, package manager, depending on what seems
  relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also
  reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities
> or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker,
> or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by
> email to [report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live).

We use CodeBerg issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into
an issue with the project:

- Open a new issue using the respective template.
- Explain the behavior you expect vs the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the
  _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate
  the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For
  good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a
  reduced test case that explicity replicates the behavior.

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your
  provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
  obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for
  those steps and mark the issue as `State: Blocked`. Bugs with
  the `State: Blocked` tag will not be addressed until they are
  reproduced. We do not want to guess and check which can
  potentially cause us more issues.
- If our team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked
  `State: Help Wanted`, as well as possibly other tags (such as
  `Priority: Critical`), and the issue will be left to be
  [implemented by someone like you](#your-first-code-contribution)
  or queued up in our backlog of issues that need addressed.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement
suggestion for Amethyst, **including completely new features and
minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these
guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand
your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the documentation carefully and find out if the
  functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual
  configuration.
- Perform a issue search to see if the enhancement has already
  been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue
  instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the
  project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the
  project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in
  mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority
  of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just
  targeting a minority of users, consider writing an
  add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as issues via the Codeberg
repository.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to
  identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested
  enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior
  you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can
  also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs**
  which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part
  which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most
  Amethyst users. You may also want to point out the other
  projects that solved it better and which could serve as
  inspiration.
